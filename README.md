# PhantESPThing
Connecting the Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing to Phant (soldering on optional TMP102 and TSL2561)

To use, put in your phant public and private key for a feed with the following three keys; "name," "temp," and "lux." Optionally, un-comment the line to send battery voltage as well and add the "batt" key. Solder a wire between the reset via in the middle of the board and the XPD pin. On the first run, the ESP8266 thing will go into soft AP mode; connect to it and it will request credentials to get on your network. Once it successfully authenticates, it will continuously update via Phant!

This sketch takes advantage of the ESP8266's ability to sleep for two purposes. First, sleeping allows us to get a lot more use out of the device--with a 210mAh battery, this sketch can run for about 14 hours sleeping 30 seconds between reads. Second, sleeping mitigates the problem of the ESP8266 heating up the TMP102 on the board; with the chips always on, there is about a 5 degree C rise on the board; with 30 seconds of sleeping, I see only a 0.1 degree C rise.
